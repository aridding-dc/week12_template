# README

This is a short introduction to utilizing GitHub for Project Archiving and Versioning. 

At this point we have learned about databases and introduced SQL. 

### SQL
We have practiced using SQL to perform basic data analysis including:
- Pull data with `SELECT`
- Apply conditional label with `CASE WHERE`
- Filter with `WHERE`
- Aggregate with `GROUPBY`
- Sort with `ORDER BY`

### Python and `pandas`
- Reading from flat file with `read_csv`
- Connect to database with `read_sql`
- Select columns with `df[column_name]`
- Select rows with `df[df[column_name] == value]`

### Visualizing with `matplotlib`
- Preparing the data for visualization
- Created a basic bar plot with `.bar()`
- Created a basic line plot with `.plot()`


### GitHub and GitHub Desktop
- A project folder: `repository`, 
- A version of the code, could be localized `branch`, 
- A small message with changes made on your branch `commit`, 
- A way to add your changes to the branch `push`, 
- Combine change with the `master` via a `pull request`
